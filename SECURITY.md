# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: Full support |
| < 0.1   | :x:                             |

**Support policy:** Releases within the last 90 days receive full support (security patches, bug fixes). Older releases are unsupported -- please upgrade to the latest version. Review the [release notes](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnConfigGenerator/releases) when upgrading.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of opnConfigGenerator seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, use one of the following channels:

1. [GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnConfigGenerator/security/advisories/new) (preferred)
2. Email [support@evilbitlabs.io](mailto:support@evilbitlabs.io) encrypted with our [PGP key](#pgp-key) (verify the full fingerprint below before use)

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Scope

**In scope:**

- Path traversal in file input/output handling
- Command injection via CLI arguments
- Sensitive data exposure in generated mock configurations (e.g., if real keys leak into output)
- Dependency vulnerabilities in the supply chain

**Out of scope:**

- Vulnerabilities in OPNsense or pfSense themselves
- Issues requiring physical access to the machine running opnConfigGenerator
- Social engineering attacks
- The generated mock data itself is intentionally fake -- it is not a vulnerability that fake keys or passwords appear in output

### What to Expect

**Note**: This is a passion project with volunteer maintainers. Response times are best-effort and may vary based on maintainer availability.

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **1 week**
- We will provide an initial assessment within **2 weeks**
- We aim to release a fix within **90 days** of confirmed vulnerabilities
- We will coordinate disclosure through a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnConfigGenerator/security/advisories)
- We will credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to respond to issues before any disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying other users' data
- Avoid actions that could negatively impact other users

## Security Features

opnConfigGenerator includes several security-focused features:

- **Memory-safe implementation**: Pure Go with no `unsafe` package usage
- **Offline-first design**: No network access at runtime; built for airgapped environments
- **Deterministic output**: Seeded RNG ensures reproducible, auditable output
- **No real secrets**: All generated keys, passwords, and certificates are fake data
- **Dependency auditing**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Supply chain transparency**: CycloneDX SBOMs and Sigstore attestations per release

## Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Report vulnerabilities through the channels described above

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy.
